      <h1>Reflecting on Software Engineering</h1>
      <div class="essay-content">
        <p>
          Going into ICS 314, it would have been easy to assume the course was mainly “how to build a web app.”
          Web development was definitely a major outcome, but the bigger takeaway for me is that software engineering
          is really about building systems in a way that stays understandable, repeatable, and maintainable even when
          the project grows or the team changes. The tools and frameworks we used were just the beginning. Configuration 
          management, coding standards, and user interface frameworks apply to almost any software project, even ones 
          that have nothing to do with the web.
        </p>

        <p>
          Configuration management is one of the most important ideas I learned because it solves a problem that shows
          up everywhere. Keeping a project's “state” consistent over time and across people. Configuration management
          is the practice of controlling and tracking changes to a software system so you can reliably answer questions
          like “What changed?”, “Who changed it?”, “Why was it changed?”, and “How do we get back to a known working
          version?” In this class, GitHub was the main tool used to implement configuration management. The concept is 
          bigger than version control. It also includes managing dependencies, documenting how to build and run the 
          project, and making sure the same code can be reproduced in different environments.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of web development, configuration management becomes even more critical. For example, a robotics team
          working on embedded code, a data science group training models, or a game studio building a multi-platform
          release. All of these things need a reliable history of changes and a way to coordinate work without overwriting 
          each other. The ability to use branches for isolated development, pull requests for review, and tagged releases
          for stable milestones is not “web-specific” it is a general method for reducing chaos. What I value most
          about learning configuration management is that it turns software work into something you can audit and
          reproduce instead of something that only works “on my machine.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Coding standards were another major shift in how I think about software engineering. A coding standard is a
          set of agreed upon rules and conventions that make code more consistent and easier to read. That can include
          formatting (indentation, naming style), structure (how files are organized), and even behavioral expectations
          (avoiding certain patterns that cause bugs). In this course, tools like linters help enforce standards
          automatically. What surprised me is how much coding standards are not about being strict for no reason, they
          are about communication. Code is read far more often than it is written, and standards make that reading faster.
        </p>

        <p>
          In non-web contexts, coding standards matter just as much, if not more. In a backend service, inconsistent
          error-handling or unclear naming can create subtle production issues that are hard to trace. In safety-critical
          systems, like medical devices, standards can be the difference between a reviewable system and one that hides 
          mistakes. Even on solo projects, standards help future you, because it is much easier to return to a clean 
          codebase than a messy one. The biggest lesson I learned is that “working” code is not the finish
          line, maintainable code is.
        </p>

        <p>
          User interface frameworks were the third topic that felt like “web stuff” at first, but ended up teaching
          broader engineering ideas. A user interface (UI) framework is a reusable set of components, layout tools,
          and design conventions that help developers build consistent interfaces efficiently. Frameworks like Bootstrap
          provide ready-to-go styling and responsive layouts, while component based approaches (like React) encourage
          organizing UI into small pieces with clear responsibilities. The deep lesson here is standardization and reuse, 
          instead of reinventing basic elements. Frameworks provide proven building blocks so developers can focus on
          the unique logic of the product.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond web development, the “framework” mindset still applies. Desktop apps as well as mobile applications use UI 
          frameworks mobile applications. Even command line tools have interface conventions and patterns that work like a 
          framework. They have consistent flags, predictable outputs, and a standard help menu. More importantly, UI 
          frameworks taught me the importance of designing for users and designing for change. A UI is not just appearance, 
          it is a contract between the system and the person using it. When a system grows, a framework helps prevent the 
          interface from becoming inconsistent and confusing, because it encourages repeated patterns and shared components.
        </p>

        <p>
          What ties these three topics together is that they all support professional scale software. Configuration
          management protects the project's history and makes collaboration safe. Coding standards make the codebase
          readable and reduce avoidable bugs. UI frameworks reduce reinvention and encourage consistency and reuse.
          None of these depend on whether you are building a website, a mobile app, a game, or a backend service. They
          are transferable habits that make software engineering feel less like improvisation and more like a disciplined
          craft.
        </p>

        <p>
          If I had to summarize what I learned in one sentence, it would be this: Software engineering is the set of
          practices that makes software reliable for people other than the person currently typing. ICS 314 helped me
          build more than web pages, it helped me build a workflow and mindset that I can apply to almost any project 
          I work on in the future.
