            <h1>Reflecting on My Use of AI in ICS 314</h1>

            <div class="essay-content">

                <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Artificial intelligence has become an increasingly common tool in education, especially in
                    technical fields such as software engineering. Many modern AI systems are capable of generating
                    code, explaining complex concepts, and assisting with debugging, which makes them particularly
                    relevant in a course like ICS 314. Throughout this course, AI served as a supplemental tool that
                    helped clarify concepts, reduce friction when stuck, and support learning rather than replace it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I primarily used AI in a targeted way, focusing on understanding concepts, debugging issues, and
                    organizing ideas for writing. I intentionally avoided using AI in situations where independent
                    problem-solving and speed were the primary learning objectives. The AI tools I used most often
                    were ChatGPT and Claude.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>AI tools used:</strong> ChatGPT, Claude<br>
                    <strong>Usage pattern:</strong> Used selectively when stuck or clarifying concepts
                </p>

                <h2>II. Personal Experience with AI</h2>
                <p>
                    The following sections describe how I used—or intentionally avoided using—AI across the major
                    course elements in ICS 314, including the benefits and drawbacks of each.
                </p>

                <h3>1) Experience WODs (e.g., E18)</h3>
                <p>
                    I occasionally used AI before starting experience WODs to better understand the concepts involved
                    or to get a high-level sense of how to approach the problem. I avoided using AI during the timed
                    portion because these WODs are meant to build speed and confidence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The benefit was reduced confusion at the start, while the downside was that AI sometimes suggested
                    solutions that were overly complex or ignored assignment constraints.
                </p>

                <h3>2) In-class Practice WODs</h3>
                <p>
                    Practice WODs were a low-risk environment where I felt comfortable using AI. I used it mainly to
                    interpret error messages or understand why a solution was not working.
                </p>
                <p>
                    AI explanations were helpful, but they still required verification through testing or
                    documentation.
                </p>

                <h3>3) In-class WODs</h3>
                <p>
                    I rarely used AI during in-class WODs due to time constraints. In many cases, relying on AI would
                    have slowed me down rather than helped.
                </p>

                <h3>4) Essays</h3>
                <p>
                    I used AI primarily to help with outlining and improving clarity in essays. AI was useful for
                    organization and flow, but the personal reflection content still came from my own experience.
                </p>

                <h3>5) Final Project</h3>
                <p>
                    For the final project, I used AI to help debug issues and break larger tasks into smaller steps.
                    AI was most useful when I provided detailed context.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, AI-generated code often required significant review to ensure it met project constraints
                    and linting rules.
                </p>

                <h3>6) Learning a Concept / Tutorial</h3>
                <p>
                    AI was especially helpful for learning new concepts when documentation felt dense. Simplified
                    explanations helped me understand ideas more quickly.
                </p>

                <h3>7) Answering a Question in Class or Discord</h3>
                <p>
                    I occasionally used AI to help phrase responses more clearly, but I avoided relying on it when I
                    was unsure of the correctness of the answer.
                </p>

                <h3>8) Asking or Answering a Smart-Question</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the most effective uses of AI was transforming vague confusion into well-structured,
                    clear questions that were easier for others to answer.
                </p>

                <h3>9) Coding Example (e.g., Underscore .pluck)</h3>
                <p>
                    I used AI to generate small, focused code examples to better understand specific functions or
                    library methods.
                </p>

                <h3>10) Explaining Code</h3>
                <p>
                    AI explanations were useful when revisiting code or reading unfamiliar code, though I still
                    verified understanding by stepping through the logic myself.
                </p>

                <h3>11) Writing Code</h3>
                <p>
                    AI-generated code was used mainly as a starting point. I treated it as a draft and made
                    significant changes to match project requirements.
                </p>

                <h3>12) Documenting Code</h3>
                <p>
                    AI helped speed up documentation by improving clarity and structure, but all documentation had to
                    be verified for accuracy.
                </p>

                <h3>13) Quality Assurance (ESLint, debugging)</h3>
                <p>
                    AI was useful for interpreting ESLint errors and suggesting potential fixes, though care was taken
                    to avoid unintended behavior changes.
                </p>

                <h3>14) Other Uses in ICS 314 Not Listed</h3>
                <p>
                    I also used AI for planning tasks and checking assignment requirements against rubrics to ensure
                    completeness before submission.
                </p>

                <h2>III. Impact on Learning and Understanding</h2>
                <p>
                    When used intentionally, AI improved my learning experience by reducing frustration and helping
                    me move forward when stuck. At the same time, it required increased critical thinking to verify
                    results and avoid shallow understanding.
                </p>

                <h2>IV. Practical Applications</h2>
                <p>
                    AI has practical value beyond ICS 314, especially for documentation, debugging, and early-stage
                    planning in real-world software engineering tasks.
                </p>

                <h2>V. Challenges and Opportunities</h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenges were incorrect or overly confident responses and solutions that ignored
                    constraints. There are opportunities to integrate AI more intentionally as a learning aid rather
                    than a shortcut.
                </p>

                <h2>VI. Comparative Analysis</h2>
                <p>
                    Traditional learning methods build strong foundations but can be slow, while AI-enhanced methods
                    increase speed and accessibility. A balanced combination of both proved most effective.
                </p>

                <h2>VII. Future Considerations</h2>
                <p>
                    AI will likely play an increasing role in software engineering education, shifting focus toward
                    evaluation, verification, and reasoning skills.
                </p>

                <h2>VIII. Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Overall, AI was a helpful but imperfect tool in ICS 314. When used thoughtfully, it supported
                    learning and productivity without replacing essential problem-solving skills.
