            <h1>Coding Standards Reflect</h1>
            
            <div class="essay-content">
                <p>
                    Coding standards are much more than a set of guidelines for code 
                    formatting; they are the building blocks of clean, maintainable, 
                    and scalable software development. By enforcing consistent practices 
                    like indentation, naming conventions, and modular design, coding 
                    standards not only improve the readability of code but also foster 
                    a culture of collaboration and learning. In my experience, even 
                    seemingly small things like brace position can boost understanding 
                    and reduce mental load, especially in transitioning between different 
                    programming languages. In the end, these conventions create a 
                    fundamental foundation that allows developers to focus on creating 
                    complex solutions rather than deciphering cryptic code.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After having had ESLint integrated with VSCode in my first week of use, 
                    my overall experience has been challenging but informative. The process
                    of eliminating all ESLint problems has sometimes been exhausting, 
                    particularly when dealing with minute stylistic details that hardly 
                    impact functionality. However, the stringent approach has also provided 
                    valuable lessons on potential landmines and overlooked best practices 
                    in my coding. It has compelled me to strip away ambiguous language 
                    nuances and adopt a more reflective approach in coding, thereby gradually 
                    enhancing the quality and efficiency of my projects.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Reflecting on my coding standards experience, I currently firmly hold 
                    the opinion that coding standards are simultaneously an educational 
                    tool and a gate for quality. As programmers, embracing rules—even 
                    prescriptive rules—forces us to analyze our habits and ultimately code 
                    cleaner and more stable programs. Throughout this essay, I have included 
                    thoughts sharpened with continued practice coupled with support by AI 
                    tools like ChatGPT in terms of brainstorming sessions and structure. 
                    That collective work is open and is in line with my commitment to 
                    continually improving my ability at software engineering.
